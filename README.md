# responsive_portfolio

This is my responsive portfolio for homework #2. 

I used Bootstrap by Twitter for the gird system and formatting.

The project contains an index.html, portfolio.html, contact.html, and style.css pages.

Each page contains a card with sub grids within the cards for formating.

Each page was put through an HTML validation service for formatting and corrections.

Thank you for reading!
